# @upstash/context7-mcp

## 4.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 16095a9: Update CLI prompt, terminal display, and browser launch dependencies. The CLI now declares Node.js 22.13 or later, which its dependencies already need. Update the MCP server JWT and OpenTelemetry dependencies.
- 72181dd: Serve a SEP-2127 server card at `/mcp/server-card`.

## 4.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 5ed5e9a: Disable unused MCP notification subscriptions so clients do not hold open SSE streams for static tool, prompt, and resource collections.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 915abfe: Add bounded OpenTelemetry metrics for MCP requests, tools, authentication, and upstream API calls, exposed for Prometheus on the HTTP server's internal telemetry port.

## 4.0.7

### Patch Changes

- 0087bab: Allow the Claude Code plugin to use anonymous access when its API key header is empty.

## 4.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 5a7039b: Add per-request bearer-token providers and Vercel Marketplace resource OIDC validation.
- 80e681a: Return sanitized JSON-RPC errors for rejected MCP request bodies.

## 4.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 21c3dd4: Require authentication and track usage separately for the Claude Code plugin.
- 4e980f6: Increase the default HTTP subscription capacity and allow deployments to configure it with `MCP_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS`.
- 2a851fc: Remove the legacy AES-CBC client-IP header now that authenticated assertions are deployed.

## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 8fa6c6b: Honor the advertised `X-Context7-API-Key` header in HTTP MCP requests.
- 794cc6b: Authenticate hosted MCP client-IP forwarding with short-lived AES-GCM assertions.

## 4.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 769c6cd: Advertise Clerk as the OAuth authorization server so clients validate authorization responses against the issuer that Clerk returns.

## 4.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 67528f2: Add a 60s `AbortSignal.timeout()` to both Context7 API calls in `lib/api.ts`. Without a signal a stalled backend call rides undici's ~300s default before failing. 60s is generous: these are vector queries with p99.9 ~3.2s, and no request exceeded 30s across a full day of production traffic.
- c68104e: Disable SSE keepalive heartbeats on the HTTP handler (`keepAliveMs: 0`). Every tool is a millisecond vector query, so no legitimate exchange needs a heartbeat — but a hung exchange kept alive by heartbeats can never be reaped by a proxy's stream idle timeout. One such hang is deterministic: a 2025-era JSON-RPC batch carrying a request plus its own `notifications/cancelled` gets no response for the cancelled request (per spec), the SDK transport then never closes the stream, and heartbeats kept it alive until the gateway's 1200s hard cap — the dominant source of leaked upstream connections in the 2026-08-11 mcp.context7.com outage. With heartbeats off, silent hangs go idle and the proxy reaps them at its idle timeout.

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- af7e4ad: Stop forcing `responseMode: "sse"` on the HTTP handler and use the SDK default `"auto"` instead. Forcing `"sse"` put every response on an SSE stream, and those streams were not released: concurrent upstream streams went from ~10 before v4.0.0 to over 5000, exhausting the gateway connection pool and returning 503 `reset reason: overflow` on `mcp.context7.com`. Traffic and latency were unchanged over that period, so the growth was not load.

  With `"auto"` a request is answered with a single JSON body unless a handler emits a related message before its result, which upgrades that one exchange to SSE. No tool emits progress today, so modern-protocol responses are now plain JSON. The 2025-era legacy fallback is constructed without a `responseMode` and still streams over SSE, so it is unaffected.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 8d52608: Migrate the MCP server to the v2 SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/{node,server,client}` 2.0.0) and the 2026-07-28 protocol revision. HTTP serving is now stateless for both modern and legacy clients, and Redis-backed sessions are removed.

## 3.2.5

### Patch Changes

- beded6c: Bump `undici` to 7 and require Node.js >= 20.18.1. On Node 26+ (internal undici 8) the bundled undici 6 `setGlobalDispatcher` wrote a global-dispatcher symbol the built-in `fetch` no longer reads, so `HTTPS_PROXY` and custom-CA settings were silently ignored and requests failed with `ENOTFOUND` behind CONNECT proxies. undici 7 writes both symbols, restoring proxy and CA support. Node 18 is no longer supported (EOL; undici 7 requires Node >= 20.18.1).
- 1c081df: Improve query prompts so agents request relevant library documentation instead of passing the task to complete.

## 3.2.4

### Patch Changes

- c61a565: Bump jose from 6.1.3 to 6.2.3.

## 3.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 41878ec: Skip loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`), link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`), CGNAT (`100.64.0.0/10`), IPv6 loopback (`::1`), IPv6 link-local (`fe80::/10`), and IPv6 unique-local (`fc00::/7`) addresses when extracting the client IP from `X-Forwarded-For`, so proxy-internal hops no longer pollute the reported client IP.
- 33229cb: Clarify the `query-docs` query description so it asks for a single concept per query. When a question spans multiple distinct topics, callers are now told to make a separate query per concept instead of combining them (unless the question is about how the concepts interact), which avoids diluted, shallow results. Applied consistently across the MCP server, CLI, pi, and AI SDK tools.

## 3.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 2253765: Validate Enterprise-Managed Auth (id-jag) access tokens at the MCP server, so MCP clients can authenticate to Context7 through an enterprise IdP (Okta) via the MCP Enterprise-Managed Authorization extension.

## 3.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 8123b51: Restore Node 18 support by pinning undici to ^6.26.0 and commander to ^13.1.0, which dropped the Node 20+ engine requirements that caused a "File is not defined" crash on startup.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c921c8b: Replace the in-result sign-in nudge with an MCP form elicitation. When the backend signals (via `X-Context7-Auth-Prompt: 1`) that an anonymous client has crossed the per-IP threshold, the MCP server now fires an `elicitation/create` request instead of appending instructions into the tool result.
  - Surfaces the `npx ctx7 setup --<client> --mcp[ --stdio] -y` command in a client-rendered dialog rather than as model-visible text. The previous text-injection approach was treated as untrusted instruction content by some agents; elicitations are delivered out-of-band to the user so they bypass that path entirely.
  - Gated on the client advertising the `elicitation` capability — clients without it see no nudge, which is a safe no-op.
  - Presents a two-option radio: "I'll run the command to sign in" or "Continue anonymously with smaller limits".
  - The server holds no suppression state: the backend emits the header at most once per MCP session, so the dialog is shown whenever the header is present. Frequency is owned entirely by the backend.
  - Fire-and-forget: the elicitation does not block or alter the surrounding tool response.

### Patch Changes

- cb6aee1: Bump runtime dependencies: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.25 -> 1.29, `undici` 6 -> 7, and `zod` 4.3 -> 4.4.
- fcdc36e: Advertise empty `prompts` and `resources` capabilities with no-op `prompts/list`, `resources/list`, and `resources/templates/list` handlers. Some MCP clients (e.g. opencode) call these unconditionally and treat `-32601 Method not found` as a fatal connection error rather than honoring the negotiated capabilities, which previously prevented the server from loading.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fb2d42: Add multi-tenant Microsoft Entra ID validation for MCP tokens. The server now detects inbound Entra v2 tokens by issuer pattern, fetches per-teamspace configuration (`tenantId`, `audience`, `requiredScope`) from the Context7 app, and verifies the token against the matching tenant's JWKS, enforcing the required scope claim when configured. User resolution happens downstream in the Context7 app against a pre-provisioned user mapping table — the MCP server only validates. Per-tenant JWKS cache and a 5-minute in-memory config cache keyed by JWT audience reduce overhead under load.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- af6a7b5: Convert the stateless MCP implementation to a stateful one using Redis for session management.

### Patch Changes

- 3d73145: Reduce Redis writes on `refresh` by checking the remaining TTL first and only issuing `EXPIRE` when the session is within one day of expiry.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 34fda7d: Prompt anonymous users to sign in. After the backend signals (via the `X-Context7-Auth-Prompt: 1` response header on `/v2/libs/search` or `/v2/context`) that an anonymous client has crossed the per-IP threshold, the MCP server appends a one-time sign-in invitation to the tool result.
  - Both **stdio** and **HTTP** transports surface the same nudge: a tool-result notice asking the assistant to run `npx ctx7 setup --<client> --mcp -y` (with `--stdio` appended when the MCP server is running on stdio) after explicit user confirmation. The CLI handles OAuth and writes credentials into the MCP client's config; the user restarts their MCP server / editor to pick up the new credentials.
  - Detects the calling client from `X-Context7-Client-IDE` / User-Agent and selects the matching CLI flag (`--cursor`, `--claude`, `--codex`, `--opencode`, `--gemini`); falls back to interactive setup when unknown.
  - HTTP transport remains stateless — the threshold is tracked by the backend (per-IP, 24h TTL), the MCP server only reacts to the signal.

## 2.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 187287c: Accept hallucinated argument names on `tools/call` requests by rewriting them to the canonical names before validation. `userQuery` and `question` are mapped to `query` on either tool; on `query-docs`, `context7CompatibleLibraryID`, `libraryID`, and `libraryName` are mapped to `libraryId`. Some LLM clients produce these alternative names — likely echoing phrasing from each tool's description — and previously triggered `Invalid input: expected string, received undefined` errors. `libraryName` is only rewritten on `query-docs` calls because it is the canonical arg for `resolve-library-id`. Tool input schemas published via `tools/list` are unchanged: canonical names remain the documented required fields, the rewrite is purely a server-side compatibility shim that runs only on `tools/call` and only when the canonical key is absent.
- 78b9826: Exit the stdio MCP server when the parent process closes its stdio. Previously, if the parent (e.g. Claude Code) was force-killed shortly after a tool call, an idle undici keep-alive socket to the Context7 API would keep libuv's event loop alive past stdin EOF, leaving an orphaned `node` process that consumed memory until the kernel tore the socket down (which on Cloudflare-fronted endpoints can take hours). The server now listens for `end`/`close` on stdin and `SIGHUP` and exits cleanly. Fixes #2542.

## 2.2.4

### Patch Changes

- d0e4a48: Create a fresh `McpServer` per HTTP request. Sharing one across requests let any concurrent `transport.close` clear the shared `Protocol._transport`, which broke `sendNotification` for in-flight long-running tool calls.
- 1aa3430: Remove research mode entirely from the MCP server and CLI. The `query-docs` MCP tool no longer accepts or forwards a `researchMode` parameter, and the CLI no longer exposes a `--research` flag on `ctx7 docs`.

## 2.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 772da3a: Stream MCP tool responses over SSE so HTTP headers flush before client `fetch` timeouts. Switching `enableJsonResponse` to `false` makes the SDK return the HTTP response synchronously after request validation, so headers are sent in milliseconds instead of being buffered until the tool completes. This fixes clients that cap the underlying `fetch` waiting for headers (e.g., Claude Code's 60s `wrapFetchWithTimeout`).

## 2.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 8274bd0: Add missing tool annotations
- ff6c1be: Remove the `researchMode` parameter from the `query-docs` tool's input schema. The underlying API still supports research mode, but several MCP clients hit per-request timeouts (60s defaults) on long-running research calls in ways that can't always be solved server-side. Hiding the parameter prevents agents from invoking it through MCP until the timeout story is reliable across clients.
