# Changelog

## 0.5.14

### Patch Changes

- 16095a9: Update CLI prompt, terminal display, and browser launch dependencies. The CLI now declares Node.js 22.13 or later, which its dependencies already need. Update the MCP server JWT and OpenTelemetry dependencies.

## 0.5.13

### Patch Changes

- 9b6f702: Accept trailing commas in OpenCode JSONC config files during setup and removal.

## 0.5.12

### Patch Changes

- 4416fb8: Use the shared API URL for login and explain how to sign in again when the server rejects a saved session.

  Recommend logout and login only when the server returns HTTP 401. Report other identity-check failures without asking users to discard saved credentials.

## 0.5.11

### Patch Changes

- e127fa1: Add outbound-independent on-premise MCP setup through `ctx7 setup --base-url`, including secure interactive personal API-key entry and anonymous-auth discovery support.

## 0.5.10

### Patch Changes

- 76140fc: Use API keys returned by the device login flow directly during MCP setup instead of sending them to a dashboard session endpoint to generate another key.

## 0.5.9

### Patch Changes

- 3abc99a: Recover library IDs mangled by Git Bash when Git is installed through Scoop.
- 118c852: Preserve existing Codex TOML settings when rotating stdio API keys.

## 0.5.8

### Patch Changes

- 91dea9f: Fix `ctx7 library`, `ctx7 docs` and `ctx7 skills suggest` silently falling back to anonymous requests when the stored OAuth token expires, which surfaced misleading quota errors for authenticated users. `ctx7 generate` no longer forces a full interactive re-login when the token can be refreshed instead. All four commands now go through `getValidAccessToken()`, which refreshes expired credentials.

  A successful refresh also keeps the stored `refresh_token` when the server omits one from the response, as permitted by RFC 6749 §6. Previously the response was written verbatim, so the refresh token was dropped and the user was silently logged out at the next expiry.

## 0.5.7

### Patch Changes

- b89a04e: `ctx7 setup` now writes the API key as a standard `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header instead of a custom `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` header. Codex resolves a server's auth mode from `bearer_token_env_var` or a header literally named `Authorization`, so a custom name read as "no credential configured": Codex fell through to an OAuth credential stored against the same server name and URL, refreshed it during startup, and when that refresh token was dead the server failed with `invalid_grant` before the API key was ever sent. The hosted endpoint accepts both header forms, so existing configs keep working.

## 0.5.6

### Patch Changes

- 23843e9: Read the GitHub CLI auth token by invoking `gh` directly instead of through a shell. The shell wrapper (`cmd.exe /d /s /c` on Windows) caused endpoint protection tools such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to raise a "Suspicious Node.js process behavior" alert during `ctx7 setup`.
- c82cc8a: Fix `ctx7 setup` skill install failing with "fetch failed" when the GitHub git tree API (`api.github.com`) is blocked or unreachable. Skill download now falls back to fetching the single `SKILL.md` directly from `raw.githubusercontent.com` — the URL the docs API already resolves — so setup succeeds in environments where only the docs/raw hosts are reachable.
- 1c081df: Improve query prompts so agents request relevant library documentation instead of passing the task to complete.

## 0.5.5

### Patch Changes

- e1b4793: Surface the underlying network error when an OAuth request fails. Connection failures now report the cause (TLS interception, DNS, firewall, timeout) with a hint, and non-JSON error responses report the HTTP status and body excerpt instead of a generic message.

## 0.5.4

### Patch Changes

- 33229cb: Clarify the `query-docs` query description so it asks for a single concept per query. When a question spans multiple distinct topics, callers are now told to make a separate query per concept instead of combining them (unless the question is about how the concepts interact), which avoids diluted, shallow results. Applied consistently across the MCP server, CLI, pi, and AI SDK tools.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- acd0d46: Surface GitHub API error details when skill download fails (#2363)

  Previously, any GitHub API failure during `ctx7 setup` or `ctx7 setup --cli` produced the opaque message "GitHub API error", making it impossible to distinguish a 403 rate-limit from a 401 bad token or a 404 wrong branch.

  Changes:
  - `fetchRepoTree` and `fetchDefaultBranch` now extract the HTTP status and GitHub error body, returning descriptive strings like `"HTTP 403: API rate limit exceeded"`
  - `listSkillsFromGitHub` distinguishes a true 404 (repo not found) from other errors (rate-limit, bad credentials) that previously all collapsed into the same silent result
  - When a request fails unauthenticated with a 403/429, a hint is shown: `run \`gh auth login\` or set the GITHUB_TOKEN env var to increase rate limits`
  - Failed skill entries in the setup results table now show a red `✖` with the error detail on its own line instead of embedding it in the status string

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- cb6aee1: Bump runtime dependencies: `commander` 13 -> 15 and `ora` 9.0 -> 9.4.
- 428af3e: Recover Context7 library IDs that Git Bash mangles on Windows. Git Bash rewrites a leading-slash argument like `/facebook/react` into a Windows path under the Git install dir (`C:/Program Files/Git/facebook/react`), causing `ctx7 docs` to reject it as invalid; this mainly affected users running ctx7 through Claude Code. The CLI now detects and undoes the conversion before validation, accepts the `//owner/repo` escape, and points users at that workaround for install layouts it can't auto-detect.
- c03bc9c: Store CLI files in XDG Base Directory locations instead of `~/.context7`. Credentials move to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/context7` (default `~/.config/context7`), updater state to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/context7` (default `~/.local/state/context7`), and `generate` previews to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/context7` (default `~/.cache/context7`). Existing files in `~/.context7` are migrated automatically on first use; migration is best-effort and falls back to reading the legacy file if it cannot complete. The credentials file is always re-asserted to `0o600` after migration or write so it is never group/world-readable. Relative or empty `XDG_*` values are ignored per the spec.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- ea91d7d: `ctx7 login` now always uses the device-code flow. The localhost-callback path is removed — every install (laptop, SSH, Codespace, Docker, CI) goes through the same boxed prompt and verification page. Drops the `--device` flag (it was the opt-in for what's now the default). Older CLI versions (≤ 0.5.0) continue to work against the unchanged auth endpoints, so pinned installs are unaffected.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5a180d5: Add OAuth 2.0 device authorization flow (RFC 8628) for `ctx7 login` and `ctx7 setup`. Required for headless / remote hosts (SSH, Codespaces, Docker, CI) where the existing localhost-callback flow can't work — the browser was opening on the user's laptop while the callback listener ran on the remote host.

  The new flow prints a verification URL and short code, then polls a token endpoint. The user visits the URL on any device, signs in, and approves; the CLI receives the same `ctx7sk-…` API key it would have gotten from the legacy flow. Device flow is selected automatically when `SSH_CONNECTION` is set or `$DISPLAY` is missing on Linux, and can be forced with `ctx7 login --device`. Polling tolerates transient network errors and 5xx responses without ending the session.

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 2affada: `ctx7 setup` now properly supports `--antigravity`, installing skills to `.agent/skills`, a `GEMINI.md` rule section (Antigravity reads Gemini-family config), and MCP config to Antigravity 2.0's documented global path `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` (with `httpUrl` for HTTP, matching the Gemini convention). Antigravity has no documented project-level MCP file, so `setup --antigravity --project --mcp` writes to the global location. Also removes the `--universal` flag from `setup`, which was advertised but silently ignored — it never propagated through agent selection, so passing it (e.g. `setup --cli --universal --project`) caused setup to fall back to auto-detection and write to the wrong directory.
- 268f52f: `ctx7 setup --api-key <KEY>` (without `--cli`, `--mcp`, or `-y`) now prompts to choose between MCP server and CLI + Skills modes. Previously, passing `--api-key` short-circuited to MCP, locking users out of the CLI + Skills option even though that mode also accepts an API key. Explicit `--mcp` / `--cli` / `--stdio` / `--oauth` / `-y` still skip the prompt as before.
- 2e97dae: Add deprecation warning to skill commands

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 7cacc94: Add `--json` flag to `ctx7 skills list` for machine-parseable output. Emits `{ skills: [{ name, path, source }] }` where `path` is absolute and `source` is the agent type (`universal`, `claude`, `cursor`, `antigravity`). Matches the existing `--json` pattern on `ctx7 library` and `ctx7 docs`.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- dea0e43: Declare `@inquirer/core` as a direct dependency of the CLI. It was previously imported in `selectOrInput.ts` but only resolvable as a transitive of `@inquirer/prompts`, which caused `ctx7` to fail at startup with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` under pnpm's isolated node linker.
- 34fda7d: Add `--stdio` flag to `ctx7 setup` to configure Context7 as a local stdio MCP server.
- 61de754: Harden skill name handling during `ctx7 skills install` and `ctx7 skills remove`. Skill names from remote `SKILL.md` files are now restricted to a safe character set, and the install sinks assert the target directory is a direct child of the skills root before writing.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 6c71e4d: Handle malformed MCP config files gracefully during `ctx7 remove` agent detection. Previously, an unparseable JSON config at any agent's well-known path (e.g. a hand-edited `~/.claude.json`) would crash the command with an unhandled `SyntaxError` before it could do anything. The detector now skips the offending file and logs a warning naming the path and parse error so the user can fix it, while detection continues for the remaining agents.
- 4056850: Respect `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env var when resolving Claude Code's global config, rules, skills, and detection paths

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 1aa3430: Remove research mode entirely from the MCP server and CLI. The `query-docs` MCP tool no longer accepts or forwards a `researchMode` parameter, and the CLI no longer exposes a `--research` flag on `ctx7 docs`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 17b864f: Expose research mode through the MCP `researchMode` tool and the CLI `docs --research` flag for deep, agent-driven documentation answers.

### Patch Changes

- 4feee15: Add CLI update notifications and a new `ctx7 upgrade` command. The CLI now checks for newer versions with cached state, shows a non-blocking notice before interactive commands, and provides safer upgrade guidance across npm, pnpm, bun, and ephemeral runner setups.
- f056b14: Add `ctx7 remove` as the cleanup counterpart to `ctx7 setup`, with safer detection and removal behavior. The command now prompts only for agents with actual Context7 artifacts, preserves non-Context7 MCP configuration when removing entries, and includes stronger test coverage for JSON and TOML cleanup.

## 0.3.13

### Patch Changes

- 3f6e310: Fix skill installation path validation on Windows so valid files inside the target directory are not rejected due to backslash-separated resolved paths.

## 0.3.12

### Patch Changes

- 33f2338: Add Codex-specific CLI setup guidance so generated rules and the installed `find-docs` skill tell Codex to rerun Context7 CLI requests outside the default sandbox after DNS or network failures.

- 04130b5: Consolidate skills under /skills with canonical sources: rename docs→find-docs, ctx7-cli→context7-cli, add context7-mcp as canonical MCP skill. MCP setup now downloads skill from GitHub instead of using hardcoded content.
- d418405: Add CLI mode to ctx7 setup for installing the docs skill without MCP configuration

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 31b4fb8: Align CLI library output format with MCP: use labeled fields (Title, Context7-compatible library ID, Description, Code Snippets, Source Reputation, Benchmark Score, Versions) and categorical reputation labels (High/Medium/Low/Unknown) instead of numeric trust scores

### Patch Changes

- 6328ed1: Skill search & generate command improvements:
  - Add "Installs" and "Trust(0-10)" columns to skill search results with aligned column headers
  - Auto-login via OAuth when the generate command requires authentication instead of showing an error
